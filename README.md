## **How to Use This Repository**

To explore the solutions:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shivang1209-dot/CS50x.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the directory of the respective problem set:
   ```bash
   cd CS50x/<problem-set-folder>
   ```
   Replace `<problem-set-folder>` with the folder name of the problem set you wish to explore.

3. Open the relevant files to review the solutions.

4. Though, I'd recommend you to solve these problems yourself...
